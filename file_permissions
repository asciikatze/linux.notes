"Permissions" File attributes that define who can access or change a file and wheter a file can be executed as a program.

"-rwxr-xr-x" Shows file type and prmissions

	d = directory
	l = link

	Permission	Octal	Field
	-rwx------	700	User
	----rwx---	070	Group
	-------rwx	007	Other

Octal values:

	Read = 4
	Write = 2
	Execute = 1
	
	8 bits = 1 byte. Uses digits 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7.

You can set permissions with the command "chmod" Examples:

chmod 755 <filename> Set a file to be executable and readable by everyone but only writable by you
chmod +x <filename> Set execute bit without changing other permissions

When applying permissions to directories on Linux, the permission bits have different meanings than on regular files.

The write bit allows the affected user to create, rename, or delete files within the directory, and modify the directory's attributes.
The read bit allows the affected user to list the files within the directory.
The execue bit allows the affected user to enter the directory and access files and directories inside.

# FILE OWNERSHIP

chown -R <user>:<group> <directory>	#set folder ownership, -R apply to files within directory
