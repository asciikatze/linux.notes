# When applying permissions to directories on Linux, the permission bits have different meanings than on regular files.
# The write bit allows the affected user to create, rename, or delete files within the directory, and modify the directory's attributes.
# The read bit allows the affected user to list the files within the directory.
# The execue bit allows the affected user to enter the directory and access files and directories inside.
